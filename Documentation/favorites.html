						<p>The Favourite Song System (FSS) is for you who can't remember which modules you like to hear. Okay, that was a bit of a joke! It will automatically store the names (by using the database, which needs to be enabled in the settings) of all the modules your have heard during your run of NostalgicPlayer. In addition to that it remembers how many times you have heard the same module. All the names are put into a list, from which the FSS takes a user specified number of played modules and put them into the window. This window displays the top list placements and how many times each module has been played.</p>

						<p>It is possible to move the columns around, so that the order of the columns can be selected.</p>
						<p>If you doubleclick an item in the list it will be added to the bottom of the module list.</p>
