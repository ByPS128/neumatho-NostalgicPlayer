						<p>This is a list of the module types NostalgicPlayer can play. The list contains all module types, not only the different players. This is the way I count the number of supported module types which can be played.</p>
						<p>For each module type, there are information about how it's handled. The <b>Player</b> information tells which player that is used to play the specific format.</p>
						<p>Some formats does not have an embedded player, so they are converted. If that's the case, the converter that is used is written under the <b>Converter</b>. It also tells which formats it converted from.</p>
						<p>This way an agent can convert several kinds of exotic modules into one common format, playable by NostalgicPlayer. On the other hand, some of the players (e.g. ModTracker) can by itself play more than one module format, like pro/noise/star-tracker.</p>
						<p>You can download modules in each format on our own homepage at <a href="https://www.nostalgicplayer.dk" target="_blank">https://www.nostalgicplayer.dk</a> or you can try to make a search on the internet.</p>
