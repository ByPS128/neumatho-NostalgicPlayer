						<a name="formats"><h3>Formats</h3></a>
						<img src="images/settingsagentsformats.png" alt="formats"/>
						<br>
						<p>This is a list of all available formats that can be played. Some formats have their own player, some are converted. See the <a href="moduletypes.html">module types</a> for more information about each of them.</p>

						<img src="images/settingsagentsplayers.png" alt="players"/>
						<br>
						<p>A player is capable of detecting a module format and play it. There exists two kinds of players. Module players and sample players.</p>
						<p>A module player plays notes in upto 64 different channels. A mixer will then mix all the channels into a 2 channel stereo output.</p>
						<p>A sample player will read one bit of the file at the time and play it. There is no mixing involved when playing samples.</p>
						<p>A third option are module converters. A module converter will convert one module format to another format where a player exists. This player will then load the converted module and play it.</p>
					</span>
					<span>
						<a name="output"><h3>Output</h3></a>
						<img src="images/settingsagentsoutput.png" alt="output agents"/>
						<br>
						<p>An output agents job is to take the output from either the mixer or a sample player and play it.</p>
						<br>
						<table class="usage2table">

								<td>Core Audio</td>
								<td>This agent uses the Windows Core Audio API to play the sound, so the user can listen to it.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>

						<img src="images/settingsagentssampleconverters.png" alt="sample converter agent settings"/>
						<br>
						<span>
							<p>A sample converter can read a specific sample format. This is used by the sample player to play samples in different formats.</p>
							<p>Some converters can also save samples in their format. This is used by e.g. the Disk Saver output agent to save the sample generated.</p>

						<img src="images/settingsagentsdecrunchers.png" alt="decruncher agent settings"/>
