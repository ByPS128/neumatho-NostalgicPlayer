						<p>Have you ever wondered what modules are made of? Most modules consists of a number of small sound bites called samples. They are stringed together in certain way to create a piece of music. With the "instrument/sample information" window you get the possibility to view/play and save these samples. As you can see below, a list is displayed containing lots of information on the samples. Here is a short explanation of the columns.</p>

						<p>Information in window can be sorted at any columns, just click on the header. It is also possible to move the columns around, so that the order of the columns can be selected.</p>

							<tr>
								<td><b>Name</b></td>
								<td>The name of the sample, often used by the composer to give information about the tune.</td>

						<a><h3>Samples vs. instruments</h3></a>
						<p>Maybe you have been wondering what the difference between samples and instruments are. It's actually very simple. The samples are the actual sound clips, while the instruments are different interpretations of them, meaning that one sample can become many different instruments with different parameters. The main use for this is to have one instrument where the sample is maybe fading away and another instrument where the frequency is changed a bit. All in all it gives the composer many new possibilities when creating modules without having the same sample present more than once in the module.</p>
